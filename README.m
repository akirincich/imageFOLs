% repository for imageFOL software updates
% This code is designed to provide a better FOL processing algorithm in Matlab. Details of the method 
%  can be found in the companion paper, 
%
% "Improved Detection of the First Order Region for Direction Finding HF Radars
%   using Image Processing Techniques"  by A. Kirincich, JOAT (submitted-2016)   
%
% The Main script to start with is
%
% codar_DP_imageFOLtest_07122016.m
%
% which will load the example data files and call
%
% HFR_spect_load_v2.m        % to load the data files
% imageFOLs_v07122016.m      % to estimate the FOLs using the new technique
%
% imageFOLs_... 
%     - calls  pksfinder.m   from within
%     - requires the image processing toolbox in your version of Matlab
